This is my approach on BigMart’s sales insights.

This post is my take on the BigMart’s sale. According to the information provided, Bigmart is a big supermarket chain, with stores all around the country, we look to see sales per product, for each store. BigMart has collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. With this information the corporation hopes we can identify the products and stores which play a key role in their sales and use that information to take the correct measures to ensure success of their business.
